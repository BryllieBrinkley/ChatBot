## ChatBot Project
ChatBot is a functional chat bot that responds differently based on the type of user input.
The chat bot can handle user questions, simulate thinking time, and provide different responses based on the input.

## Project Overview / Features
- UI Integration: Provides an interactive user interface for input and output.
- Asynchronous Responses: Simulates processing time for a more realistic interaction experience.

## Features
